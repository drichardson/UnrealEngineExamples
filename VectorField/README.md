# VectorFields
VectorFields in this example were authored from
[this Houdini Indie Project](https://github.com/drichardson/HoudiniExamples/blob/master/vectorfields.hiplc)
following the instructions from Houdini's
[Game Tools | Vector Fields to UE4 page](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/exporting-vector-fields-to-ue4/).

The particle systems use GPU particles. GPU particle systems need a fixed bounds defined so that the renderer knows when they can be visible. This is discussed in [Into to Cascade: Creating a CPU Spite Emitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcesEW380lc&t=310s).
